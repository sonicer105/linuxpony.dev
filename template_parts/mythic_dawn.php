                Mythic Dawn is a female bat pony of average stature and build for a bat pony of her gender and age. She
                is a female, young adult, with a light and dark striped brown mane and tail, and gray coat. Her bangs
                are straight cut and her mane is done up in a ponytail secured by a purple hair band. Sprouting from her
                back is two gray bat wings with a dark brown membrane. Her tail is long and neat, matching her mane.
                She has purple eyes and fangs visibly poking out from behind his closed lips. On her flank sits her
                cutimark; a depiction of two blue spheres crossing over in an X formation.

                Under her tail, between his hind legs is a mare pussy. The area immediately surrounding her slit and
                anus is a darker shade of gray then the rest of her coat. Lower down between her legs is a set of
                perky mare tits, along with a set of small boobs they are attached to.

                Mythic was born to the Dawn bat pony family and grew up in Canterlot her whole life. She grew up along
                side her adoptive brother Swift Dawn the changeling. The two grew up very close to each other and
                developed a strong bond. They eventually moved in together as roommates in a town house in Canterlot's
                middle class district. Mythic had an interest in joining the royal guard from a young age, desiring to
                continue to family's long history of serving Canterlot and the princesses. She eventually joined up
                officially, patrolling the castle grounds at night and securing the premises.

                Mythic can be described as high energy. Though she can be mature and take thing seriously, particularly
                at her job, she loves to let loose and be herself. She's fun loving, a bit foalish at times but
                ultimately her hart is in the right place. She has a strong allegiance to the moon princes and her
                extended bat pony family, willing to fight and die for them. Mythic loves dating ponies though the dates
                usually don't go anywhere. She finds them entertaining for the most part and loves to teas her would be
                partners. Apart from that, mythic loves to go for long walks around the city, meet up and hang out with
                her mare friends, go clubbing, and read a good novel (she finds trashy romance entertaining).
