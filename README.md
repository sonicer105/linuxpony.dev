# linuxpony.dev

This is the code for [linuxpony.dev](https://linuxpony.dev)

It isn't the most well written thing in the world so don't judge me too harshly. I tried to keep it simple and mostly
static.

## Requirements

- Tested with Apache. `/.htaccess` and `/share/.htaccess` will have to be re-written if you use a different web server.
- At least PHP 7.2
- Any requirements listed by h5ai (if included; see below)

## Installation

1) Clone the repository to the root of your web server
2) (OPTIONAL) Download and unpack the latest release of [h5ai](https://github.com/lrsjng/h5ai) to the root of your web server
