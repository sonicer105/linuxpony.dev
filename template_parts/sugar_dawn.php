                Sugar Dawn is a female alp-luachra of average size for her species, fitting in the palm of a human hand.
                She looks almost like a miniature earth pony, with the exception of having a snake like tail and a
                different coat color along her belly. Though she is an adult and fully matured for her species, she is
                a bit younger then Swift and Mythic. Sugar is a female, young adult, with a light and dark striped green
                mane, and a two toned brown coat and tail. Her mane is slicked back and short, taking a naturally
                glistening look, being naturally oily and hydrophobic. The same oily and hydrophobic property can be
                found on her coat, making it easy to maneuver in tight situations. her underbelly is a lighter shade of
                brown, that coloration continuing up her neck and down her tail. She has a pair of curious blue eyes and
                freckles on her face.

                Under her tail, between his hind legs is a fairly innocuous slit unlike a pony mare's pussy. When
                not aroused, the slit blends in, making it easy to miss. Sugar's reproductive system is closer to
                that of amphibians then mammals, laying eggs when reproducing. She has no mammaries but does have a
                anus a little further down her torso.

                Sugar was born in the Everfree Forest. Her species doesn't really do families so she was left to fend
                for herself. Growing up in relative seclusion from society, she survived in her natural habitat to
                adulthood before Mythic crossed paths with her. The two formed a bond and Mythic decided to bring her
                home as a new member of the family. Sugar grew quite close Swift and Mythic, quickly picking up language
                skills and learning about the world. She spends her days at their residence, relaxing and causing
                whatever mischief she can.

                Sugar is a troublemaker. Wherever she pops up, her antics are not far behind. She has a bad habit of
                trying to push things as far as she can until she inevitably gets in trouble. She isn't evil, she just
                struggles with the concept of boundaries, especially personal ones. She does actually care though and is
                genuinely apologetic if she hurts someone. She loves to play games and excels at puzzles and logic
                problems. She's also quite good at math, sometimes assisting swift with his day job. She does get lonely
                sometimes, being that she doesn't know anyone of her own kind to connect with but does have a few
                friends outside of the dawns to play with. Sugar enjoys cooking, puzzles, and creating rube goldberg
                like machines in the house.
