            <p>
                Swift Dawn is a male changeling of average stature and build by pony standards. He is a male, young
                adult, with an blue messy mane and tail, and dark gray soft chitin. On occasion his normally soft chitin
                can be replaced with that of a short, soft fur coat. On his back sits an affixed plate of a dark blue
                chitin. This panel is slightly harder then the rest of his body's chitin. Sprouting from his back
                plating is two translucent light blue wings. These wings are surprisingly durable and flexible despite
                their fragile look but can still tear under stress. His underbelly has long grooved, black platting
                about the same softness as the rest of his chitin, wrapping from one side of his back plating, across
                his belly and up to the other side. He has blue eyes and fangs visibly poking out from behind his closed
                lips. Like normal changelings, he has holes in his front and back legs as well as a curved horn atop his
                head. Unlike normal changelings, he has pony-like ears and a full mane and tail of the aforementioned
                blue hair. His horn when using magic, gives off a soft neon green glow.
            </p>
            <?php if($nsfw) { ?>
            <p>
                Under his belly, between his hind legs is a sheath, resembling the look of a normal horse's genitals,
                but the differences become quit clear when he becomes erect, revealing a shaft with a light to dark blue
                gradient. The horsecock would be anything but ordinary as the tip and urethra of the cock can stretch to
                accommodate the traversal of golf ball sized changeling eggs to impregnate pray. The presence of these
                eggs is not absolute however and Swift posses the ability to cum like any normal pony stallion should he
                please, though the seed expelled would be infertile. He gains much more satisfaction from expelling the
                eggs, given the choice.

            <p>
                Swift was found and adopted by the Dawn bat pony family at a very young age and grew up in Canterlot his
                whole life. He never knew his biological family but is perfectly content with his adoptive one. He grew
                up with his sister Mythic Dawn, eventually living with her in a town house in Canterlot's middle class
                district. Swift learned to transform from a young age and never grew hungry due to the familial love he
                got from his family. He never developed a link with his biological hive's hive mind, presumably due to
                distance. Swift works as a civil engineer for the Royal Canterlot Engineering Guild, adopting the
                persona of a cyan pegasus with a blue mane as a cover identity. While later more widely accepted, Swift
                was used to hiding his identity from everyone, a task that proved more difficult post chrysalis's attack
                on the city.

                Swift has a chill and laid back attitude and outlook on life, taking things one day at a time. He has a
                "forgive and forget" ideology and sometimes doesn't take things as serious as they should be taken. He's
                mostly a pacifist, happy to let others do the fighting instead of himself. He has no allegiance to any
                faction but will follow his sister's lead should push come to shove. Swift was never really interested
                in any serious dating and finding his soul mate. He does have his fair share of fun with other ponies,
                most random patrons of the local bar. While he is sustained on familial love, other types have different
                tastes that can be appealing, everything from romantic to lust. Apart from that, Swift loves to go for
                long walks around the city, meet up and hang out with friends, and read a good novel (daring do is right
                up his ally).
