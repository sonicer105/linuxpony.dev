            <p>
                Rinne is a male Avali. He is of average build and stature for one of his species. His coat is
                primarily a light blue with a dark gray secondary with dark blue markings. He has white claws on his
                hands and feet along with several dark strips up his feet and legs. His coat markings are fairly
                consistent with the kita'vali subspecies with a few minor differences. His tail comes out to one single
                big feather at the end, with a large blue marking on the tip. His eyes are fairly unusual for his
                species, having whites where others just have a continuation of their iris color. Though not visible,
                Rinne has a few bio mods, although fairly basic one. These include Guardian nanites, the environmental
                protection augment (EPA) and of course a Nexus interface device, all fairly standard for Avalis.

                The backstory for Rinne has yet to be determined as this character was newly created. This section will
                be updated once a backstory is determined. This is meant to be a fursona of sorts so will likely reflect
                my own personality somewhat.
